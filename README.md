## Overview

The Contactless Car Unlocking System allows a user to unlock a car with a specific NFC card instead of using a physical key. In the following demonstration, a Buzzcard student ID is scanned at the sensor location to remotely press the unlock button inside of the car using a 5V relay. The system is powered by the carâ€™s battery which is stepped down to a low enough voltage with a voltage regulator. All components are interfaced through a custom printed circuit board (PCB) and housed in a 3D printed enclosure.

The program runs in three separate threads to manage the NFC scanner and uLCD at the same time. 
- Main Thread - Initializes uLCD and NFC scanner threads.
- uLCD Thread - Displays invalid card and card accepted messages according to card scanned.
- NFC Reader - Asks scanner for ID of card scanned, checks it against a known ID, and turns on relay accordingly.

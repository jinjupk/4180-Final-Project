# Contactless Car Unlocking System

##Overview

The Contactless Car Unlocking System allows a user to unlock a car with a specific NFC card instead of using a physical key. In the following demonstration, a Buzzcard student ID is scanned at the sensor location to remotely press the unlock button inside of the car. The system is powered by the carâ€™s battery which is stepped down to a low enough voltage with a voltage regulator.

## Overview

The Contactless Car Unlocking System allows a user to unlock a car with a specific NFC card instead of using a physical key. In the following demonstration, a Buzzcard student ID is scanned at the sensor location to remotely press the unlock button inside of the car using a 5V relay. The system is powered by the carâ€™s battery which is stepped down to a low enough voltage with a voltage regulator. All components are interfaced through a custom printed circuit board (PCB) and housed in a 3D printed enclosure.

- Three threads
- Main - Initializes uLCD and NFC scanner threads
- uLCD - Displays invalid card and card accepted messages according to card scanned
- NFC Reader - Asks scanner for ID of card scanned; checks against known ID
